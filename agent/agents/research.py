"""Research agent — investigates incidents by calling tools and correlating findings."""

# TODO: Implement ResearchAgent
# - Accept triage summary from TriageAgent
# - Call tools iteratively: log_search, metrics, deployments, runbook search (RAG)
# - Correlate findings to identify root cause
# - Build a timeline of events
# - Return findings via AgentMessage to the Remediation agent
